Ably Chat is a set of purpose-built APIs for a host of chat features enabling you to create 1:1, 1:Many, Many:1 and Many:Many chat rooms for
any scale. It is designed to meet a wide range of chat use cases, such as livestreams, in-game communication, customer support, or social
interactions in SaaS products. Built on [Ably's](https://ably.com/) core service, it abstracts complex details to enable efficient chat
architectures.

Get started using the [ðŸ“š documentation](https://ably.com/docs/products/chat).

## Supported Platforms

This SDK works on Android 7.0+ (API level 24+) and Java 8+.

## Supported chat features

This project is under development so we will be incrementally adding new features. At this stage, you'll find APIs for the following chat
features:

- Chat rooms for 1:1, 1:many, many:1 and many:many participation.
- Sending and receiving chat messages.
- Online status aka presence of chat participants.
- Chat room occupancy, i.e total number of connections and presence members.
- Typing indicators
- Room-level reactions (ephemeral at this stage)

If there are other features you'd like us to prioritize, please [let us know](https://forms.gle/mBw9M53NYuCBLFpMA).

## Usage

You will need the following prerequisites:

- An Ably account
  - You can [sign up](https://ably.com/signup) to the generous free tier.
- An Ably API key
  - Use the default or create a new API key in an app within
    your [Ably account dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard).
  - Make sure your API key has the
    following [capabilities](https://ably.com/docs/auth/capabilities): `publish`, `subscribe`, `presence`, `history` and
    `channel-metadata`.

## Installation

The Ably Chat SDK is available on the Maven Central Repository. To include the dependency in your project, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

For Groovy:

```groovy
implementation 'com.ably.chat:chat-android:0.2.0'
```

For Kotlin Script (`build.gradle.kts`):

```kotlin
implementation("com.ably.chat:chat-android:0.2.0")
```

### Dependency on ably-android

Key functionality such as sending and receiving messages is powered by the [ably-android](https://github.com/ably/ably-java) library.
The `ably-android` library is included as an api dependency within the Chat SDK, so there is no need to manually add it to your project.

## Versioning

The Ably client library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). See https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-kotlin/tags for a list of
tagged releases.

## Instantiation and authentication

To instantiate the Chat SDK, create an [Ably client](https://ably.com/docs/getting-started/setup) and pass it into the
Chat constructor:

```kotlin
import com.ably.chat.ChatClient
import io.ably.lib.realtime.AblyRealtime
import io.ably.lib.types.ClientOptions

val realtimeClient = AblyRealtime(
    ClientOptions().apply {
        key = "<api-key>"
        clientId = "<client-id>"
    },
)

val chatClient = ChatClient(realtimeClient)
```

You can use [basic authentication](https://ably.com/docs/auth/basic) i.e. the API Key directly for testing purposes,
however it is strongly recommended that you use [token authentication](https://ably.com/docs/auth/token) in production
environments.

To use Chat you must also set a [`clientId`](https://ably.com/docs/auth/identified-clients) so that clients are
identifiable. If you are prototyping, you can use `java.util.UUID` to generate an ID.

In most cases, `clientId` can be set to `userId`, the userâ€™s application-specific identifier, provided that `userId`
is unique within the context of your application.
